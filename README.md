Extracting groups of GPX files into a combined dataset

### Main QS project

This work is part of a larger project that seeks to do the following:

1. Draw together various QS datasets covering (so far) bike rides, sleep, weight, and (possibly) diet
2. Use visual analysis (e.g. Tableau) to explore correlations within the data

### Initial GPX sub-project

The first step will explore using the GPX data:

1. Extract GPX data from my bike rides in Strava into a combined dataset
2. Process individual rides to add further calculated info (e.g. distance, time, speed, HR, cadence, elevation, etc.)
3. Aggregate rides to provide various summary views

### First exploratory phase

And specifically this intial project will look at extracting the GPX data en masse

### Reference sources
