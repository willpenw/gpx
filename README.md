Extracting groups of GPX files into a combined dataset

This work is part of a larger project that seeks to do the following:
1) Draw together various QS datasets covering (so far) bike rides, sleep, weight, and (possibly) diet
2) Use visual analysis (e.g. Tableau) to explore correlations within the data

The first step will explore using the GPX data:
1) Extract GPX data from my bike rides in Strava into a combined dataset
2) Process individual rides to add further calculated info (e.g. distance, time, speed, HR, cadence, elevation, etc.)
3) Aggregate rides to provide various summary views

And specifically this intial project will look at extracting the GPX data en masse
